Overview OF The Project :-
## Simple Calculator

### Overview

The Simple Calculator project is a basic arithmetic calculator implemented in Java. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input, basic arithmetic operations, control flow, and function usage. The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features

- **Addition**: Add two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
- **Division**: Divide one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a basic understanding of how a calculator works programmatically and to illustrate the implementation of core Java concepts. This project serves as an introductory exercise for those new to Java programming.

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to the project directory**.
3. **Compile the program** using a Java compiler:
    ```bash
    javac SimpleCalculator.java
    ```
4. **Run the program** using the Java interpreter:
    ```bash
    java SimpleCalculator
    ```
5. **Follow the on-screen instructions** to perform arithmetic operations.

### Future Improvements

- **Additional Operations**: Implement additional operations such as exponentiation and square root.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a GUI for better user interaction.
- **Extended Functionality**: Support more complex calculations and scientific functions.
